# Kinodynamic_RRT_algorithm
In this project I applied the RRT algorithm for OpenAIâ€™s Car Racing Game.
The main issue of this problem was to keep the racer on the track.

# What is RRT?
RRT (Rapidly-exploring random tree) is a path planning algorithm. 

**The main steps of its operation with an illustration are presented below:**

- Randomize a set of controls in a given movement space.

- If this set gets you closer to your goal - add it to the control graph, if not - don't add it.

- Connect this newly added graph vertex to the nearest vertex.

- Repeat these operations until one of the controls is within the range of the assumed endpoint environment
